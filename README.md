# Chest-X-Ray-Images-Pneumonia

This repository contains a example of transfer learning method, based on X-ray images. The normal chest X-ray (left panel) depicts clear lungs without any areas of abnormal opacification in the image. Bacterial pneumonia (middle) typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation, in this case in the right upper lobe (white arrows), whereas viral pneumonia (right) manifests with a more diffuse “interstitial” pattern in both lungs.
